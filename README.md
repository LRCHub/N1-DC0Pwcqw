[00:09.85] Do you recall?
[00:12.76] We couldn't wait to become adults
[00:16.47] We dreamed, we grew
[00:18.86] And now we are stuck
[00:28.86] 
[00:22.06] In a grown-up's hellish paradise
[00:27.72] (I'm down on my knees, carrying our sins)
[00:30.19] In order to be heard, in order to be heard
[00:35.04] Must I deliver loud and clear in sound waves of violence?
[01:03.54] 
[00:42.75] Plastic mini trucks, dollies
[00:46.74] We were so easily satisfied and happy
[00:52.78] Even if I break your favorite teddy bear
[00:58.03] A "sorry" could fix everything
[01:13.03] 
[01:04.32] When did it change? When did we forget?
[01:09.25] Why is it now so hard to forgive?
[01:14.20] Do we advance, never stopping our steps
[01:19.08] Because we are scared to look back on what we did?
[01:44.08] 
[01:24.67] Do you recall?
[01:27.52] Back when a smile was more than enough to make us friends
[01:34.63] Do you recall?
[01:37.72] We couldn't wait to become adults
[01:41.51] We dreamed, we grew
[01:44.09] And now we are stuck
[01:54.09] 
[01:46.71] In a grown-up's hellish paradise
[01:52.73] (I'm down on my knees, carrying our sins)
[01:55.27] Pretending you're still here, pretending you're still here
[02:00.15] As my confidence disappeared, I clung onto your silence
[02:27.65] 
[02:10.62] Even if tricycles become battleships, finger guns become real
[02:18.92] We are still lost
[02:27.42] 
[02:22.58] Where's our tomorrow?
[02:27.39] Where does our future go?
[02:31.50] Does our hope have to be sown upon somebody's sorrow?
[02:58.00] 
[02:46.53] Truth is, I know as long as we live
[02:51.66] Our ideals dye rivers scarlet
[02:56.56] Firing shots in the name of justice
[03:01.89] Declaring love, we can only reminisce
[03:06.72] As cruelty becomes heroic
[03:11.78] I'm on your ark
[03:13.88] Answer me, my sinking ship
[03:26.88] 
[03:17.66] Where's our tomorrow?
[03:22.03] Where does our future go?
[03:26.93] Does our hope have to be sown upon somebody's sorrow?
